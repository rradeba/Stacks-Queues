Restaurant Order Management
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to implement an order management system for a restaurant using stacks and queues.

Problem Statement: You have been tasked with developing an order management system for a busy restaurant to streamline the ordering process and improve customer satisfaction. The restaurant receives orders for food and drinks from customers, and the orders need to be processed and delivered efficiently. Your objective is to design and implement a system that uses stacks and queues to manage incoming orders, prioritize them based on factors such as preparation time and customer waiting time, and ensure timely delivery to customers.

Task 1

Design a queue-based data structure to represent the kitchen's order queue, where orders are processed in the order they are received. The first order in is the first one out.
Task 2

Implement functions to add new orders to the kitchen's order queue and remove orders when they are completed.
Expected Outcomes:

Students will understand the challenges of managing orders in a restaurant environment.
Students will gain experience in designing and implementing systems using stacks and queues to manage workflows and optimize processes.
Students will demonstrate their ability to apply data structures to real-world problems in the context of restaurant order management.



Browsing History Management
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to implement a Browsing History manager using a Stack. 

Task 1: Design a Stack-based structure to represent your browsing history where you have the ability to: 

 Add a new page (add to the Stack)
Remove a page (Remove from the Stack)
Check to see how many pages you have viewed in your browsing session
Check to see if you current browsing session is empty.
NOTE: Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your file and clicks the run button at the top, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements, print statements, or for loops, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected. If you have a function, make sure the function is called and runs. If there are classes/objects, make sure they are instantiated and the methods are called.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your Python file runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
